# Robotin 

An Arduino-based project that involves microcontroller programming to create a mobile robot that can follow objects, detect obstacles, avoid collisions, and respond to changes in ambient light. 

## Details

Robotin consists of two main parts:

1. **Robotin Part 1 (Arduino Uno)**: This part controls the movement of the robot and its reaction to obstacles using ultrasonic distance sensors. The robot will follow objects, avoid collisions and change its path accordingly. 

2. **Robotin Part 2 (Arduino Nano)**: This part controls the decorative LEDs on the robot's trunk and activates white LEDs and a siren-like buzzer in response to changes in ambient light detected by the photoresistor.
